Lots of problems

I had to cut/file some pieces, especially the gears supports (I forgot to add a way to put them in :/)
The measurements on the real flute were good because the printed part sounds exactly like the real one
But the piston mechanism (not the gears, just the piston) is awful. There is only one spot where the sound is pretty stable and really changes as the piston moves.
But the range of this spot is from F6 to G6 :/

Causes: I think there are 4 problems:
I filed the separation between the tubes so the piston doesn't get stuck. But maybe this changes the sound. I should print the entire tube at once
The piston probably lets air go past it. I should find a way to get better isolation without getting too much friction
It seems that the whislte should be as free to move as possible to produce a good sound. So I should use some sort of pillars instead of gluing it to the support.
I think the air blower isn't powerful enough because the sound is clearer when I blow in it instead of using the air blower.
