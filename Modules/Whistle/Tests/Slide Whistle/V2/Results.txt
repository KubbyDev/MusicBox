Sounds much better be still can't reach the minimum of one octave (I only get D# to G).
Causes:
 - The separation between the tubes should be as far as possible from the whistle. When it was centered it messed everything up, now it only messes up the high notes.
 - The piston leaks air, I think the notes would be clearer if it didn't
 
Other improvements:
 - The rack hole is too wide, it doesn't help it stay centered
 
Tests to do:
 - Put something to prevent air leakage around the piston
 - Test the gear system
