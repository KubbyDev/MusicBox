Initially I wanted to use the 28BYJ-48 but I broke it.
So I dissassembled and repaired it, but lost one of the gears in the process
So I just used a JM-24BYJ found in a camera

Resistances (Omh):
Brown - Red: 21
Brown - Blue: 42
Brown - Black: 42
Brown - Yellow: 42
Blue - Black: 42
Blue - Yellow: 42
Blue - Red: 21
Red - Yellow: 21
Red - Black: 21
Yellow - Black: 42

Interpretation:

          Blue
           |
           ||
           |
Brown -=- Red -=- Black
           |
           ||
           |
         Yellow

The order of the wires on the motor is Black Yellow Red Blue Brown. So probably:
Br   Blu Bla    Y
|  R  |   |  R  |
\-/¨\-/   \-/¨\-/


But I didn't manage to make it work :/

So I went back to the 28BYJ-48
I noticed the central shaft holding the rotor was bent, so I put it in place and decided to test it without the gear reduction.
But the motor was getting stuck any ways and didn't have enough power to properly push the piston
