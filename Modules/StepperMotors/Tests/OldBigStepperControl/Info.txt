Couldn't find any information about this old stepper motor I found in my fathers garage
I had to figure it out by myself:

Wires:
White (WH), Black (BK), Red (RD), Red White (RW), Blue White (BW), Blue (BL)

Information written on the motor:
TYPE 103G775-2142
DC 5.6V
0.6A
1.8 DEG/STEP

Resistances (Ohm):
WH - BW: 10
WH - BL: 10
BW - BL: 20
BK - RW: 10
BK - RD: 10
RW - RD: 20

Interpretation:

BW    BL  RW    RD
|  WH |   |  BK |
