Couldn't find any information about this old stepper motor I found in my fathers garage
I had to figure it out by myself:

Wires:
Brown, Black, Yellow, Orange, Red, Red2

Information written on the motor:
Volt: 12
Phase: 4
Ohm/Coil: 25
Deg/Step: 7.5
Sankyo HH7-1166
MSAE048C56

Resistances (Omh):
Brown - Black: 50
Yellow - Orange: 50
Red - Brown: 25
Red - Black: 25
Red2 - Yellow: 25
Red2 - Orange: 25

Interpretations:
2 coils:
